	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>Learning laravel was a great experience. It is  web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as authentication, routing, sessions, and caching. Laravel is accessible, yet powerful, providing powerful tools needed for large, robust applications. A superb inversion of control container, expressive migration system, and tightly integrated unit testing support that gives the tools needed to build any application with which you are tasked.</p>
